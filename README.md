# Analysis of Graduation Rates in Higher Education

The aim of this project is to examine higher education data from institutions within the [MidField](https://midfield.online/) (Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development) database. We explore student demographics through descriptive summary statistics and visualizations. Additionally, we train and evaluate predictive models guided by educational domain insights. Collectively, this analysis aims to understand the predictors/ features that are most significant to a student's graduation from a four-year bachelor's degree program.

This project is divided into three stages: an exploratory analysis of trends and patterns in the data, domain insights and feature identification, and finally, implementation and investigation of multiple predictive models. Each section is available in a professional and comprehensive report that narrates the analysis.

# More Information About the Data

The Midfield database used in this project provides anonymized student-level records for 98,000 undergraduates at three US institutions from 1988 through 2018. The database consistes of four key data tables:

- Course_information, (e.g., course name & number, credit hours, and student grades)
- Term_information, (e.g., program, academic standing, and grade point average)
- Student_Demographics, (e.g., age, sex, and race/ethnicity)
- Degree_Information, (e.g., institution, program, term, and baccalaureate degree)

Note: Data at the “student-level” refers to information collected by undergraduate institutions on individual students.
